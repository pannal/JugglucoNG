/**
 * How far apart two readings may be before the chart stops connecting them.
 *
 * The native renderer behind the notification chart (`JCurve::histcurve` in
 * `curve/curve.cpp`) walks history *positions* and breaks the path only on a missing
 * slot — elapsed time never enters into it, so consecutive 15-minute records always
 * connect. This chart only has a flat list of timestamps from mixed sources, so the
 * equivalent rule has to be expressed in time:
 *
 *   [HISTORY_INTERVAL_MS] — the coarsest cadence the app stores, Libre 1/2 NFC history
 *   + [WRITE_DRIFT_MS]    — a slot's stored time is `writeTime - (currentId - slotId) * 60`,
 *                           and adjacent slots get written by different scans or BLE
 *                           packets, so their second-offsets differ by up to a minute
 *   + margin
 *
 * At 17 minutes two adjacent history slots always connect however they drifted, while a
 * genuinely missing slot — 30 minutes or more — still breaks the curve. That distinction
 * is the point: a hole in the data has to look like a hole, so this must not be raised
 * to cover one.
 *
 * [ChartLineRun] handles what remains, mirroring the `nvgCircle` upstream draws for a
 * one-point run: a reading with no neighbour close enough to join becomes a dot rather
 * than nothing at all.
