/**
 * GDH-style delta run-length counter behind the FALLING_FAST / RISING_FAST alarms.
 *
 * Robust, model-free "you're dropping/rising fast" detection: it counts consecutive
 * non-overlapping intervals whose change (via [GlucoseDelta]) exceeds [deltaThreshold] in the
 * alarming direction, and fires once a run of [deltaCount] such intervals has accumulated while
 * the value is past [deltaBorder]. No extrapolation, no insulin, no smoothing.
 *
 * The delta itself stays rolling: it is recomputed for every reading over the configured
 * 1-or-5-minute window, exactly like NG's Δ readout, so the threshold is cadence-independent:
 * "10 mg/dl per 5 min" means the same on a 1-minute sensor and a 5-minute one. The *counter*,
 * however, advances only at interval checkpoints: the first steep delta starts the run (that
 * delta already covers one interval of movement), and it is re-judged at the first reading a
 * full interval later, whose rolling delta covers the adjacent, non-overlapping interval. On a
 * fast stream, consecutive rolling windows overlap almost entirely, so counting every reading
 * would satisfy [deltaCount] within a few readings instead of `deltaCount × interval` minutes.
 * On a sensor that reports exactly once per interval, every reading is a checkpoint and the
 * behaviour is the same as counting readings.
 *
 * Between checkpoints, a delta reversed against the alarming direction breaks the run
 * immediately; a delta that is merely no longer steep enough leaves the run standing until the
 * next checkpoint decides. A NaN delta (no usable history, or the pair straddles a data gap)
 * breaks the run at once.
 *
 * One instance per direction, fed the current display value on every evaluation. It advances only
 * on a genuinely newer reading timestamp, so scheduler ticks (which re-pass the same reading) and
 * calibration-only display changes cannot inflate the counter. It fires once per steep run and
 * re-arms only when the run breaks; repeat nagging is left to the shared snooze / retry machinery.
