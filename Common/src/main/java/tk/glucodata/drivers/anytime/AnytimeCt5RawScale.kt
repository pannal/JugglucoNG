/**
 * Per-sensor conversion from working-electrode current to glucose, learned from the
 * transmitter's own output while it is still producing one.
 *
 * A CT5 computes glucose in firmware and simply stops at `INFO_COMPLETE_END`, leaving a
 * sensor that still reports live current and temperature but no reading. Measured across
 * 1451 vendor readings of a full 17-day life, its output is a pure proportional scaling of
 * `Iw` — Ib is 0, there is no filtering (step-to-step roughness of the vendor's glucose
 * equals that of the current, ratio 1.00) and no lag. So the whole of what the firmware
 * adds is one scalar, and that scalar is learnable.
 *
 * What it is *not* is constant: it climbs through early life (11.4 at day 0, peaking 15.2
 * around day 4) and then decays about 0.9%/day. Fitting it over a whole life is therefore
 * wrong; fitting it over a trailing window is not. Out of sample, a window fitted one to
 * two days before the tested period predicted the vendor's own glucose to 1.5-4% MARD.
 *
 * The app's existing `computeLinear` cannot be used for this. With the K/R this sensor
 * reports over its own SSN it predicts 158 mg/dL where the transmitter said 107 — that
 * formula is shaped for CT3 and is 71% high here.
