// OttaiBleManager.kt — BLE state machine for Ottai CGM.
//
// Flow after connect: discover -> requestMtu -> enable notifications (history,
// live, cgm-info) -> Auth V2 (read device time, read device param+sign, verify,
// write app param+sign, derive ECDH session key) -> STREAMING (decrypt+parse
// live/history). Activation is a separate, explicitly-gated action because it
// starts the sensor's irreversible lifetime (see OttaiDriver.requestActivation).
//
// The crypto/auth/parse are delegated to the unit-tested OttaiCrypto/OttaiBleAuth/
// OttaiParser. This manager only sequences GATT ops and wires results. GATT
// timing details will be refined during field testing; the structure + crypto
// calls are faithful to the decompile.
